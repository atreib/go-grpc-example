# ðŸš€ gRPC + GO

This project is a study project about using gRPC with the Golang.
We're going to have 4 different projects, one for each communication pattern:

- Unary (classic Client-Server Request-Response model): `/unary`
- Unidirectional: Client Streaming
- Unidirectional: Server Streaming: `/server-streaming`
- Bidirectional

The project itself is going to be very simple: _We're going to sign up users._
Also, we're going to use the same module and the same schema for the 4 projects, in order to decrease the LoC.

Continue exploring this project by the CONTRIBUTING.md file, in the root directory, or accessing each one of the patterns implemented.
